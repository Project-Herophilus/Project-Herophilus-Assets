# iDaaS (intelligent Data as a Service) Platform
As we thought about how to brand our efforts we ended up settling on iDaaS (Intelligent Data as a Service). The core enablement
we focused on providing for healthcare was to ensure we help reduce the data barriers within healthcare. Our key focus is
<b> Data as an Asset</b> and to enable rapid innovation with data in healthcare. We are focused on delivering cloud native assets
that can run in a customer private, public or hybrid cloud environment(s) as the customer needs them. We will continue to
drive solving business problem and running anywhere securely and at scale.
