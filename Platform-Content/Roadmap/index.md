# Roadmap
We wanted to provide a place where resources can see what we are working on. Currently, we have been very engaged with so many implementations, we are working on a way to work with more
resources and provide a forum for these requests. Our goal as we have worked on maturing is 
taking all feedback from users, implementers and busines based resources and continued to 
grow the capabilities we deliver.

As we have continued to mature we have added in Defects and Discussions to all repositories and work 
to continue focusing on all the ways we communicate with our partners.

## iDaaS Design Patterns/Reference Architecture(s)
