# Architecture
As you hopefully seen we have worked really dilligently to true and ensure a very sound set of principles with anything 
that we helped develop, or deliver to the healthcare market. As it turns out we did not have to develop much at all, 
it has mostly been about taking the amazing contributions of dozens of organizations, consultants, and architects. 
We focused on delivering our capabilities whle shaping the assets into what the healthcare industry could leverage. As this 
effort was going on we world started to struggle with the Covid-19 pandemic and shortly after this 
started the US healthcare system was needing to address the CMS Interoperability Final Rule.

## Conceptual Architecture
As we looked at the contributions and all the principals we had we quickly took stock of how many Red Hat customers
were leveraging these capabilities. With such a wide variety of healthcare business leveraging these existing
capabilities we moved to q high level conceptual architecture of what the iDaaS platform looked like:

## Extensible Architecture 
After validating and vetting the high level conceptual architecture of what the iDaaS platform looked like we 
started constructing a physical architecture focused on scale, reusability, and extensibility. A key part of
this extensoble architecture was reusability. As we focused on reusability went back and were able to not only
validate our <a href="~/home/Capabilities" target="_blank">capabilities</a> but also ensure the capabilities were
able to address the industry needs.
