## Design Principles

For decades across the various markets within healthcare (clinical, financial, pharmacy and life sciences) integration 
has been a recurent and painful challenge for many organizations and across the healthcare industry in general. 
Within Red Hat there is a specific industry team dedicated to ensuring Red Hat's technologies meet the industry 
needs and ensuring its customers have meaningful platforms that demonstrate these capabilities, the Red Hat 
healthcare team. The focus of the team is enabling and empowering healthcare organizations to transform their 
organizations through infusing Red Hat's open organization, open source mindset and community based culture. 
As the Red Hat healthcare team started this journey they also wanted to ensure they could help showcase how Red 
Hat addressed the many variant and expansive needs of a healthcare organization. We wanted to ensure there is a 
set of specific differentiators no matter for whatever would be build and maintain:

* Extensibility
* Scalability
* Reduce Proprietary Technology, Knowledge and/or Skillsets
* Open Source Enablement
* Modern Application Development/Delivery Capabilities
* Innovative Disruption without chaos
* Deliver Consistency
* Polyglot Language Support

## Design Principles : Detailed

* Extensibility:
  The focus has been on building an extensible platform based on need and usage.The platform is just a series of components 
  that are designed for purpose and can be connected, extended or new components developed as developers and business teams 
  work together. Within the platform it is developed to enable small to large and complex healthcare organizations to leverage 
  this platform.
* Scalability: Ability to scale based on the data demands placed on the platform.
* Reduce Proprietary Technology, Knowledge and/or Skillsets:
  We have removed COTS or black box box software and have gone with a very open approach. Our approach leverages the numerous 
  leading Open Source products Red Hat is engaged in. Here are several of the technologies this platform leverages: 
  Spring Boot, Red Hat Fuse, Red Hat Process Automation Manager (Business Rules, Workflow and Complex Event Processing), 
  Red Hat A-MQ Streams (Kafka). These technologies are used across a wide variety of teams today across many industries.
* Open Source Enablement: 
  Provide the source code of the components to extend as needed. What other organization puts all its source code pubicly 
  available? Red Hat, that's who... Beyond the code think about open source related to data. Data comes from an upstream 
  system (as does source code), Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service) helps organizations with many capabilities improve 
  that data for business need, then we provide it back to other systems for their business needs.
* Modern Application Development/Delivery Capabilities:
  Where applicable everything is cloud native/container focused. Several of the platform components are based on 
  SpringBoot for easy of deployment and running.
* Innovative Disruption Without Chaos: 
  This platform is absolutely designed to enable disruption and enable innovation at the speed of business and 
  technologists. It is also designed to reduce chaos and numerous negative potential side effects of innovation.
* Deliver Consistency:
  Focus around industry standard design(s), practices and integration and development patterns. We don't require 
  deep knowledge of the industry standards to get started, just common developer skillsets.
* Polyglot Language Support:
  Enabling the use of many different programming languages. The focus here is to ensure by major capability area a 
  programming language is supported.
