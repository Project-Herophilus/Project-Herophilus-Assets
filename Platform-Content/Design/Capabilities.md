# Detailed Capabilities

While defined <a href="https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/blob/main/Platform-Content/Design/DesignPrinciples.md" target="_blank">specific design principles</a>
are a key aspect to ensure some level of success criteria for any solution developed. We wanted to ensure that design 
principles continue to influence the specific capabilities we deliver.

## iDaaS Integration 3R's Capabilities
iDaaS Integration is defined by the 3R's that it supports.

| Capability | Capability Area  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| Receive | Integration | Receive data from various formats. We have branded this capability iDaaS Connect. iDaaS Connect has seevral specific projects to ensure focus on delivering specific capabilities. These capabilities extend from receiving data we focus on industry standards to third party connectivity. Industry standards support include HL7 v2, HL7 v3/CCDA, FHIR, and EDI Claims. There are potential future plans for NCPDP message support being discussed. From a third party connectivity perspective we focus on building an on-ramp for data to be leveraged within iDaaS for over 75 common protocols like: JDBC data sources, File, FTP, SFTP, FTPS, APIs, WSDL, AS400, Mongo, Kafka, numerous cloud platforms and many more. |
| Run/Revise | Ability to Process/Parsing/Transform| This is one of the most exciting capabilities we are enabling. This is done through our DREAM component(s). DREAM, Data Realtime Management, is all about driving change in the healthcare community and building out a value exchange that can be used by anyone implementing iDaaS to add new capabilities in a low latency and very low risk. You would build a component that has the capability of acting on streaming information and being invoked in a real-time manner. These activities could include areas like event population and building, business rules enablement, third party application integration, AI, ML, dynamic mapping of data sources, cross mapping codes and many other potential examples. |
| Resolve/Research| Data Insight| Enable error handling and insight to resolve potential processing issues. Also, the need to replay messages for new needs.|
