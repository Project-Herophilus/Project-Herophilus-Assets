# Common Questions

With all this being said, <b>it was important for our code to be completely open and available with Apache 2 License!!</b>
We are sure you have questions, concerns, or doubts; such as:

* Q: I already have an integration engine or enterprise application integration platform?
  A: You should not replace an existing integration engine or EAI platform, that would take time with lots of coordination. We would argue it is working for the
  masses then you should keep it in place. Do you view that platform as strategic or innovative though? Probably not, but
  it can provide access to existing information for business efforts though. Why not use it for what is good at and build
  innovation atop it. You can also enable innovation at an enterprise, organization or team level with this model without
  sacrificing security.
* Q: I have heard all of this before and I am still not seeing any industry progress? A: The industry is evolving and changing.
  Digital in healthcare, along with several other factors, is causing the entire way healthcare data to not only be
  re-imagined but re-evaluated. This is forcing various changes including
  new and more modern integration standards.
* Q: Why would you do this? A: Its time to help lead and drive the change that will benefit everyone in healthcare, especially the patients.
* Q: Has anyone run the risk and put their code and all their work out there for the masses to leverage in this manner? A: Not until now, open-source is core to our culture amd is all about the community and open-source mindset. Because of this we decided to follow those practices for everything for this effort. We also have and will continue to publish onto GitHub through our organization.
