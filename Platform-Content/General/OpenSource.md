## Open Source Based Mindset

Red Hat business is built around pulling from upstream communities and making technologies more enterprise capable and 
secure while wrapping additional offerings around them. Our intent is, and will always remain, to enable healthcare 
to build, extend and deliver platforms while showcasing open-source in healthcare. Our path to do this has been 
different though. Since we already had very leading, popular and common upstream projects/communities such as 
Apache Camel, Drools, Drools Fusion, Apache Kafka/Strimzi, Kubeflow, Kubernetes/K8s and several others that 
are already built into very well used subscription based offerings at Red Hat. Because of this our focus was on 
ensuring we could deliver reusable design patterns and frameworks (as expressed above) within Red Hat Technologies 
first. From February through November 2020 we stayed focused and not only met this objective but also helpd numerous 
partners stand up platforms built atop this offering. In November 2020 we started planning to build out the vast amount 
of Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service) capabilities as an upstream community itself
<a href="https://github.com/Project-Herophilus" target="_blank">Project-Herophilus</a>. As we surveyed the healthcare 
community we believe this is the right move for this effort long term. Also, by doing this we are already starting to 
plan on other needed industry capabilities to help drive change. This will help us better support the healthcare industry 
and enable greater capabilities to be developed. As we start this shift here is a visual that shows how to think about this.

We are so excited about the possibilities and potential.

Our culture is all about open source and open source mindset because of this we decided to follow those 
practices for everything for this effort. All the assets are published onto Git Hub through our
<a href="https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/" target="_blank"> organization</a>. Our intent is to build and 
enable healthcare platforms and enable an open source healthcare community. As part of this community we 
wanted to provide guidelines on how we expect those to behave that join the [community](CodeOfConduct.html).
