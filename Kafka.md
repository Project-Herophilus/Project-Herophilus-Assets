# Kafka

We have included the basics for any implementation.

## Steps
1.  For this specific implementation I have created an install directory
on the drive named RedHatTech.
2. Use any Archive technology to untar the tgz file to a tar file.
3. I unzip the .zip file into <users home dir>\RedHatTech

# Running Kafka
The scripts are contained within the Repo-General/scripts/non-windows for this.
They are specifically hard coded for the <users home dir>RedHatTech\<kafka release>.
You will just need to change these if you want to use them and don't unzip
files into these locations.
